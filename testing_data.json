            "main_description": "petal, leaf, root. by Just the Goods’ facial serum for dry skin combines fast absorbing oils to hydrate without residue while also delivering a rich variety of vitamins, essential fatty acids, and antioxidants to replenish and tone skin for soft texture and a healthy glow. Rosehip seed oil is harvested from the seeds of rose bushes and is full of antioxidants vitamins A and C, and omega-6 essential fatty acids, which nourish cells deeply to protect, repair, hydrate, and promote healthy cellular turnover thanks to boosted production of collagen and elastin. Chia seed oil is noted for being a rich botanical source of essential fatty acids that are powerfully anti-inflammatory to reduce, prevent, and treat itchy, dry skin even when associated with internal medical conditions, as opposed to the sorts of dryness triggered by living in an arid climate. And, in the course of fighting irritation and dehydration, chia seed oil can help to promote a clear complexion, as well. The gamma-linoleic acid among other nutrients found in evening primrose oil are essential for retaining cell structure and promoting the elasticity of skin. This and other fatty acids are anti-inflammatory in nature, which helps to reduce redness and irritation to prevent incidences of eczema and/or psoriasis. Being so highly moisturizing, evening primrose oil reduces dryness by encouraging healthy regeneration of skin cells for softer feeling skin Castor oil is a humectant rich in triglycerides to help skin retain moisture while also stimulating new tissue growth Neroli essential oil softens skin as mildly antibacterial properties help to clear pores while imparting moisture. And, since stress causes spikes in cortisol levels which can lead to breakouts due to hormonal imbalance (i.e. acne, psoriasis, eczema, etc), neroli’s aromatherapeutic value benefits the nervous system to reduce anxiety, and ultimately benefit skin health, as well. Helichrysum is very hydrating and is known to reduce the appearance of scars by promoting cellular turnover. In this way it may also help to reduce the impacts of UV damage. A little goes a long way! Experiment by adding only a few drops to the face, and adding as desired. Take an opportunity to deeply inhale the serum before applying to experience maximum aromatherapeutic benefit.

            "main_description": "After extensive research, I've concluded that conventional products marketed as eye cream take advantage of misinformation about what skin really needs by offering formulas that contain little more than petrochemicals designed to feel light and absorb quickly, which are then packaged into smaller containers and sold at a higher price.  Over the past 10 years, clients worldwide have expressed satisfaction using my facial moisturizer for normal/sensitive skin around the delicate eye area because it is made from nutritive, non-toxic, plant based ingredients and does not contain any essential oils which might cause eyes to water or burn. Some people feel comfortable using JTG's facial moisturizer for dry skin under more extreme conditions (i.e. very arid climates, or while managing specific skin or overall conditions). Please note, however, that I *never* recommend Just the Goods facial moisturizers for oily/combination skin or acne prone skin be used around the eyes because they contain essential oils that are inappropriate for use near the eyes.  Those with oily/combination skin or acne prone skin who purchase full-sized bottles of facial moisturizer for their needs opt to purchase a small/sample sized bottle of facial moisturizer for normal/sensitive skin to be used exclusively as eye cream.  If - at some point in the future - I decided to create a wholly new formula that genuinely serves people in a better way as an exclusively single function product, you can trust that I'll be completely transparent about it and *not* take advantage of the marketplace collusion that imagines tiny jars as overpriced miracles ;-) This product can be found in the listing for Just the Goods facial moisturizer for normal/sensitive skin, but I'm offering it here as its own listing to help folks find this information more quickly/easily. *** Please note that this item ships as a 1 oz bottle of facial moisturizer for normal/sensitive skin, which is exactly what it is (as described above). I have not created new/different labels. Your will not receive a 1 oz bottle that has a label for \"eye cream\". *** Ingredient highlights: Avocado oil is rich in vitamins A, D and E, as well as potassium, proteins, beta-carotene and numerous essential unsaturated fatty acids. It also contains a high quantity of sterolins, which is reported to help reduce age spots, help heal sun damage and scars. Avocado oil is furthermore said to increase the amount of collagen in the skin, which facilitates regeneration, particularly in the case of skin that is dehydrated or otherwise affected by difficult climates (i.e. Winnipeg’s dry winters). Some claim that avocado oil can even help to relieve the dryness and itching of psoriasis and eczema. Apricot kernel oil has a high content of vitamins A, C, and E, as well as fatty acids such as oleic and linoleic acid. It is considered gentle enough to be used in products for babies, and is thus also suitable for mature and sensitive skin. It is well absorbed without leaving a greasy feeling, and can be helpful in calming the discomfort associated with conditions such as eczema and dermatitis. Aloe vera gel is a powerful moisturizer that simultaneously helps to remove dead skin. It also stimulates the synthesis of collagen and elastin and is known to have a healing effect on burns and other wounds, all of which translates into assisting regeneration. This handcrafted product is made without artificial preservatives. To protect it's integrity and to promote longevity, please store this product in a cool dark place and seal tightly between uses as heat and sunlight will cause premature deterioration.",
            "Format": "This product -- facial moisturizer for normal/sensitive skin that doubles as eye cream -- is offered in 25 ml/1 oz hdpe bottles. Please note that the stock image shows a larger format of the same product (118 ml / 4 oz). A new photo of a smaller bottle will be uploaded when it becomes available. There is no product with a label stating \"eye cream\". Thanks!",
            "Note": "This item is made with the the same formula that also serves as: tattoo aftercare, after sun lotion, hair smoothing lotion, and as a general hand/body lotion idea for managing mild cases of eczema (unscented lotion with apricot kernel and avocado oil). These items are bottled with different names to better serve those looking for specific items. Customer feedback has also indicated that it helps to avoid confusion with the facial moisturizers for other skin types which contain ingredients unsuitable for other purposes  Facial moisturizer for normal/sensitive skin, however, can be used as an eye cream and is being offered as such. "
